# mycyberdictionary

This is an attempt to open source my brain, notes, and nuances about different facets of cybersecurity to the public benefit.
Excuse the mess as I assimilate notes, resources, etc from the ether.

This started as trying to create some easily searchable references for myself and people that ask my questions on cyber and I finally *think* I've found the best way to go about it with this.
